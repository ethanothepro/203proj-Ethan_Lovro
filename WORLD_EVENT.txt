Project 5 Description:

Click 'd' on the keyboard to select the default method and click anywhere to trigger the event.
The default event will transform the cells in the vicinity of the selection into different background cells. If
a Dude is in the vicinity, it will transform into Mario, and if a tree is in the vicinity, it will
transform into a Coin. There is a 1/10 chance of a cactus to spawn, and the Stars (Fairies) will navigate to
the cacti and turn them into coins. Furthermore, a Pipe will spawn in the middle of the click and a Goomba
will spawn on top of it. Mario navigates toward the idling Goomba and kills it and he also collects Coins. The new
entities are Mario, Goomba, Coin, and Cactus. Mario navigates to Goombas and Coins and kills/collects them. Goomba
spawns out of a Pipe and idles. Coins just animate and wait to be collected. Cacti serve as an obstacle until the Fairy
collects them and turns them into coins.

Furthermore, selecting various other keys on the keyboard will change the event triggered. 'w' selects water, 'r' is a
stone, 'c' is a coin, 's' is sand, 'e' is Luigi. Clicking after selecting the item will spawn whatever item is selected
at the mouse location (for world building and editing). Luigi acts just like Mario but runs faster.

Lovro worked on the Coin class and item selection and Ethan worked on the Mario class and mouse tracker. The rest of the
coding/debugging was done together, for example incorporating the Cactus and the Goomba.
